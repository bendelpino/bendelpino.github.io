					<h3>Research Assistance Project - 2025</h3>
					<p>This project consists of three different subprojects (all written in Python, and all within the
						same <a href="https://github.com/bendelpino/research-code" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
							style="color:rgb(81, 81, 237);text-decoration:none;">GitHub repository</a>). <br>
						<br>
						1. A <a href="https://github.com/bendelpino/research-code/blob/main/youtube/yt_workflow.py"
							target="_blank" rel="noopener"
							style="color:rgb(81, 81, 237);text-decoration:none;">script</a> used for automating YouTube
						video data collection using the
						YouTube API and Gemini's API. Here's how it works: The user inputs a keyword for the script to
						search in YouTube. The script grabs the first 20 videos for that word, analyzes them,
						writes a summary and extracts valuable quotes from each video. The output is stored in a
						markdown
						file.<br>
						<br>
						2. A research workflow using <a href="https://exa.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
							style="color:rgb(81, 81, 237);text-decoration:none;">ExaAI</a>'s API. Built to search for
						tweets and
						store them in markdown
						files for easy reading. The project also has a general search agent.<br>
						<br>
						3. This part of the project is still work in progress, but it will be another search Agent,
						which will use <a href="https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use" target="_blank"
							rel="noopener" style="color:rgb(81, 81, 237);text-decoration:none;">BrowserUse</a>.<br>

					<h3>Econometrics Interactive Book - 2024</h3>
					<p>A project led by Professor <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ricardoanibalpasquini/"
							target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="color:rgb(81, 81, 237);text-decoration:none;">Ricardo
							A. Pasquini</a>,
						developed collaboratively with a team of students. The result is an interactive digital book
						designed for university
						students taking their first course in econometrics. It includes dynamic dashboards to help
						visualize and understand key
						concepts. I contributed specifically to the dashboard on multicollinearity.
						<a href="https://simuecon.com/en/econometrics" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

					<br>
					<h3>Defi lending analysis - 2024</h3>
					<p>This is an ongoing project focused on estimating the impact of parameter changes—whether relaxed
						or tightened—in DeFi
						lending protocols such as AAVE. My work so far has involved in-depth research, developing a
						solid understanding of the
						protocol's behavior, and, most importantly, querying and retrieving data directly from smart
						contracts.
					</p>
					<br>
					<h3>Ski Instructor, Vail, CO. - 2023/2024</h3>
					<p>In the winter of 2023/2024, I worked as a ski instructor in Vail, Colorado. This was my first
						experience working in a big team and taking on the responsibility of ensuring the safety of a
						group. It was also the first time that I had to brief the client on
						how their purchase had gone (parents paid north of $300 per day for their kids to come to the
						ski school).
						<br>
						<br>
						I learned about the nature of a workplace and the need to make one-self noticed, and that
						eventually, the honest,
						hard-working, competent individuals will succeed over the 'looters' and 'corner-cutters'. I
						learned to be patient with children and what tremendous honesty and incredible intelligence they
						possess.
					</p>
					<br>
					<h3>High School Work Experience, Isle of Man, UK. - 2018</h3>
					<p>In my final year living on the Isle of Man, UK, I participated in a two-week work experience
						program at age 16, gaining
						my first exposure to professional environments. For the first week, I worked at
						Barclays Bank, where I observed daily operations,
						and learned about customer service and financial processes. The staff at the office said I was
						the most interested student they had ever hosted. The following week, I joined the Department
						of Education, where I supported office activities, engaged with educational
						resources, and gained an understanding of administrative functions in a public sector.</p>
