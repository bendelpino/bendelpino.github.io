						<blockquote>His ideal is a Man who, having worked all day for the good of prosperity (if that

						<p>The above are two of my favourite quotes.</p>

								<h5> The Borthers Karamazov <br>- Dostoevsky</h5>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images_mine/books/karamazov.jpg"
											alt="" /></span>This book is truly astonishing. It creates a world full
									of misery in which there is still joy, happiness and love for
									existence. It delineates, through three different brothers (and the rest of the
									characters), how the point of view one
									takes in life ends up building the base of how one lives. I particularly appreciated
									the relationship between Alyosha
									and Father Zosima. The wise words of the elder feel as if Dostoevsky himself was
									talking to the reader. If you want to
									read a novel full of philosophical and psychological content, I’d recommend this
									book. <br>
								<blockquote>“… look around you at the gifts of God, the clear sky, the pure air, the
									tender grass, the birds; nature is beautiful
									and sinless, and we, only we, are godless and foolish, and we don’t understand that
									life is a paradise, for we have only
									to understand that and it will at once be fulfilled in all its beauty, we shall
									embrace each other and weep”.</blockquote>
								</p>
								<br>

								<br>
								<h5 style="text-align: right;">Meditations<br> - Marcus Aurelius</h5>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images_mine/books/meditations.jpg"
											alt="" /></span>It amazes me that Meditations, a collection of personal
									notes by Marcus
									Aurelius, was never meant for publication These are Marcus Aurelius' notes and
									reflexions, which he wrote whilst
									leading the world's biggest empire. It is him guiding and reminding himself of
									the best ways to remain calm, joyful, and peaceful throughout a turbulent life. This
									book was the
									first time I read
									about the idea of "love of fate" (<i>amor fati</i>) which I believe is a powerful
									principle for
									embracing life's challenges with resilience.
								<blockquote>“Stop allowing your mind to be a slave, to be jerked about by selfish
									impulses, to kick against fate and the present,
									and to mistrust the future”.<br><br> “To welcome with affection what is sent by
									fate.
									Not to stain or disturb the spirit within him with a mess of false
									beliefs. Instead, to preserve it faithfully, by calmly obeying God—saying nothing
									untrue, doing nothing unjust. And if
									the others don't acknowledge it—this life lived with simplicity, humility,
									cheerfulness—he doesn't resent them for it,
									and isn't deterred from following the road where it leads: to the end of life. An
									end to be approached in purity, in
									serenity, in acceptance, in peaceful unity with what must be”</blockquote>
								</p>
								<h5> Letters from a Stoic <br> - Seneca</h5>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images_mine/books/letters.jpg"
											alt="" /></span>Seneca's Letters from a Stoic
									is a great introduction to Stoic philosophy through practical, conversational
									wisdom. Some key points that stuck with me were: to speak slowly, to mourn; but not
									for too long and instead remember with happiness, and to embrace self-honesty above
									all. Seneca also teaches
									balance: a person of action must find calm, just as a reflective soul should act
									decisively. Compared to the introspective Meditations, Seneca's friendly
									style makes this book ideal for anyone exploring
									Stoicism for the first time. <br><br>
									<i>"Whenever circumstance or chance brings a welcoming thing your way, be
										alarmed and suspicious… We think these things are
										ours when in fact it is we who are caught… What fortune has made yours is not
										your
										own.” <br> <br> “What progress have I made? I am beginning to be my own friend.
										Such
										a man can never be alone.” <br> <br>“We should not keep silverware with inlays
										of
										gold, but at the same time we should not imagine that in doing so there is
										proof that we are leading a simple life”. </i>
								</p>
								<h5 style="text-align: right;">The screwtape letters<br> - C.S. Lewis</h5>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images_mine/books/screwtape.jpg"
											alt="" /></span>The Screwtape Letters was an unexpected but very enriching
									read. Thanks to
									Nacho Narbais for gifting me this book. This work is an insight into why good and
									evil matter. It depicts the human soul in a way that shows how it can be lost
									to self-destroying practices up to a point in which the same soul doesn't even
									realise it any more. It emphasises (in a
									new/different way) on how we were made in the image of God - with the freedom to
									live with our own will. When reading this, remember everything in this book is
									written from a devil's point of view. The Enemy = God. <br>
								<blockquote> “The Enemy wants to bring the man to a state of mind in which he could
									design the best cathedral in the world, and know
									it to be the best, and rejoice in the fact, without being any more (or less) or
									otherwise glad at having done it than he
									would be if it had been done by someone else. The Enemy wants him, in the end, to be
									so free from any bias in his own
									favour that he can rejoice in his own talents as frankly and gratefully as in his
									neighbour’s talents-or in a sunrise,
									an elephant, or a waterfall.” </blockquote>
